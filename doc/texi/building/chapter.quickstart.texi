@chapter QuickStart
This chapter is for building from a terminal/shell environment in as few commands as possible. Upon completion of the following commands you should have a fresh build of @value{HB.name}. Further instructions are available beginning with @ref{overview} which describes procedures suitable for repeating builds. This chapter should be skipped by those seeking more than a minimalist build.

@example
@COMMAND.checkout{}
./configure --launch
cd build/
@end example

The special option @command{--launch} selects launch mode and performs the following steps:

@itemize
@item assert scratch directory @file{build/} does not exist
@item create scratch directory @file{build/}
@item change to directory @file{build/}
@item launch @command{make}
@item capture build output to @file{build/log.txt}
@item echo build output
@end itemize
