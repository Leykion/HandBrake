This is a roadmap for future releases of HandBrake. It has to be taken
as an indication, as it may change as any time.

 + AC3 pass-through
 + Subtitle support
 + Rip only a few chapters or rip X seconds from a given starting point
 + Allow to launch rips of several titles

Maybe in 0.7.x
 + MPEG audio decoding [if I have a DVD to test it]
 + B-frames, bla bla
 + MKV muxing support
 + Manual aspect ratio
 + Better remaining time calculation
 + Nice 'About...' box with link to homepage & faq
