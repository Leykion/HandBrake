Guide to Building HandBrake svn2194 (2009030201) on Mac OS X
************************************************************

     Warning: Parallel builds on Mac OS X are currently broken when
     building in a terminal with Xcode. You must not use the `make -jN'
     jobs option. A workaround is available if you do not need to build
     HandBrake.app (MacGUI): use `configure --disable-xcode' to disable
     Xcode.

1 Introduction
**************

This guide documents the recommended process to build HandBrake on
Mac OS X hosts from the official source-code repository. Building from
any other source is not supported.

2 Prerequisites
***************

Building on Mac OS X is well supported. It is the reference platform
for HandBrake. The following are the recommended specifications for
this platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is
possible:

   * Mac Intel hardware

   * Mac OS X 10.5.6

   * Xcode-3.1.2

   * gcc 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5490)

   * yasm 0.7.2.2153 (for i386 and x86_64 architectures)

     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled
     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom
     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime
     requirements. There are of course many valid reasons to build with
     unbundled compilers, but be aware it is generally unsupported and
     left as an exercise to the reader.

The following general tools are used on various platforms and it is
recommended you use these versions or similar:

   * subversion - 1.5.5

   * python - Python 2.4.6

   * curl - curl 7.19.3 (or wget)

   * m4 - GNU M4 1.4.6

   * make - GNU Make 3.81

   * patch - Patch 2.5.8

   * tar - GNU tar 1.15.1

   * wget - GNU Wget 1.11.4 (or curl)

3 QuickStart
************

This chapter is for building from a terminal/shell environment in as
few commands as possible. If more flexibility is required you should
skip this chapter and jump to *Note overview::.

     svn checkout svn://svn.handbrake.fr/HandBrake/trunk hb-trunk
     cd hb-trunk
     ./configure --launch

The special option `--launch' selected launch mode and performs the
following steps:

   * assert scratch directory `build/' does not exist

   * create scratch directory `build/'

   * change to directory `build/'

   * launch `make'

   * capture build output to `build/log.txt'

   * echo build output

4 Overview
**********

The two general methods to build on Mac OS X are building from terminal
or Xcode. The preferred method for automated and repeatable builds is
to use the terminal. Otherwise the choice is generally up to the
individual. In essence, the terminal actually invokes `xcodebuild' to
build the very same targets contained in the Xcode project.

5 Building via Terminal
***********************

5.1 Checkout Sources
====================

Checkout HandBrake from the official source-code repository.

     svn checkout svn://svn.handbrake.fr/HandBrake/trunk hb-trunk
     cd hb-trunk

Sources are checked out from the `trunk' branch. This document was
generated from that very branch, and for example purposes, we will use
exactly the same branch.

If you have write-access to the repository, then you may add the
appropriate login/password information as needed. It is recommended to
use Subversion 1.5.0 or higher. Lower versions should also work.

5.2 Configure
=============

Configure the build system.

     rm -fr build/
     mkdir build/
     cd build/
     ../configure

Create a scratch directory which will contain all files created during
the build process. The directory name is arbitrary but we recommend
something simple and descriptive. One directory is required for each
distinctly configured build. We name our directory `build' for example
purposes.

The `configure' utility accepts many options. It is recommended that
you specify `--help' for the complete list of options. The following
options are also documented here:

`--help'
     List available options.

`--prefix=PREFIX'
     Specify destination directory for final product install.  This
     defaults to a reasonable platform-specific value.

`--disable-xcode'
     Disable driving the build through Xcode. If this option is
     disabled only `HandBrakeCLI' will be produced and Xcode will not
     be invoked. Mac OS X only.

`--disable-gtk'
     Disable building the GTK GUI on applicable platforms such as
     Linux.

`--debug=MODE'
     Select debug mode. Must be one of `none', `min', `std', `max'.
     This generally maps to gcc options `-g0', `-g1', `-g2', `-g3'.

`--optimize=MODE'
     Select optimize mode. Must be one of `none', `speed', `size'.
     This generally maps to gcc options `-g0', `-O0', `-O3', `-Os'.

`--arch=MODE'
     Select build architecture. The available architectures vary by
     platform. Most platforms support exactly one architecture except
     Mac OS X which has support for various universal binary
     architectures. The available choices are hard-coded per platform
     and no sanity checks for the required tools are performed.

`--gcc=EXE'
     Specify the `gcc' executable to use where EXE is the executable
     name which is either absolute or environment `PATH' is searched
     accordingly.

Clean-room procedures dictate that when certain factors change, old
builds should be scrapped and new builds configured. This is the main
reason for requiring a scratch directory; to promote consistent,
reliable and clean software builds. The following is a short list of
some of the reasons why someone may choose to scrap an existing build:

   * configure with different options

   * subversion working dir is updated and you want configure to
     re-evaluate working dir metadata.

   * build corruption is suspected

There are generally two methods for scrapping a build. The `build'
directory can be recusrively removed which has the effect of loosing
your existing configuration but does guarantee no residuals are left
behind. The other method is to ask the build system to perform an `make
xclean'. This is known to work well but will leave empty directories
behind. However, the configuration is left intact.

5.3 Build
=========

Build main product. All necessary dependencies are also built if
required.

     make

Parallel builds may optionally be enabled. Be aware that while a
parallel build may save time on systems with additional cores, the
output is often mixed, overlapped and sometimes even corrupted with
binary characters. Thus if you experience a build issue, you should
clean and redo the build in default serial mode to produce a readable
log. The following command allows for up to 4 concurrent jobs via make:

     make -j4

5.4 Make Targets
================

The build system supports passing many kinds of targets some of which
become very useful in normal development cycles. The targets by
convention are lower-case words passed to `make'. Global targets are
one-word targets. Scoped targets are usually two-words seperated by a
period.

5.4.1 Global
------------

`make'
     Alias for `make build'.

`make build'
     Build main product. All necessary dependencies are also built if
     required.

`make clean'
     Clean all build output excluding contrib modules. Configuration is
     retained.

`make xclean'
     Clean all build output including contrib modules. Configuration is
     retained.

`make doc'
     Build auto-generated project documentation. Various articles are
     produced and may be found in `build/doc/articles'.

5.4.2 General Modules
---------------------

General modules such as `libhb', `test' and `gtk' have the following
scoped targets:

`make MODULE.build'
     Build MODULE.

`make MODULE.clean'
     Clean build output for MODULE.

5.4.3 Contrib Modules
---------------------

Contrib modules such as `a52dec', `bzip2', `faac', `faad2', `ffmpeg',
`lame', `libdca', `libdvdread', `libmkv', `libmp4v2', `libogg',
`libsamplerate', `libtheora', `libvorbis', `mpeg2dec', `x264',
`xvidcore' and `zlib' have the following scoped targets:

`make MODULE.fetch'
     Download source tarball from the Internet and save to
     `TOP/downloads' directory. No checksumming is performed.

`make MODULE.extract'
     Extract source tarball into `build' tree.

`make MODULE.patch'
     Apply appropriate patches (if any) to module sources.

`make MODULE.configure'
     Configure module sources.  This usually invokes autotool configure.

`make MODULE.build'
     Build module.  This usually invokes autotool build.

`make MODULE.install'
     Install module products such as headers and libraries into `build'
     tree.  This usually invokes autotool install.

`make MODULE.uninstall'
     Uninstall module products; generally the reverse of install.  This
     usually invokes autotool uninstall.

`make MODULE.clean'
     Clean module; generally the reverse of build.  This usually
     invokes autotool clean.

`make MODULE.xclean'
     Extra clean module; first invokes uninstall then recursively
     removes the module build directory.

5.4.4 Contrib Aggregates
------------------------

For convenience, the following targets aggregate the all contrib
modules' respective targets together:

   * make contrib.fetch

   * make contrib.extract

   * make contrib.patch

   * make contrib.configure

   * make contrib.build

   * make contrib.install

   * make contrib.uninstall

   * make contrib.clean

   * make contrib.xclean

6 Building via Xcode
********************

6.1 Checkout Sources
====================

Checkout HandBrake from the official source-code repository.

     svn checkout svn://svn.handbrake.fr/HandBrake/trunk hb-trunk
     cd hb-trunk

Sources are checked out from the `trunk' branch. This document was
generated from that very branch, and for example purposes, we will use
exactly the same branch.

If you have write-access to the repository, then you may add the
appropriate login/password information as needed. It is recommended to
use Subversion 1.5.0 or higher. Lower versions should also work.

6.2 Build
=========

In Xcode perform the following steps to build the default configuration:

   * open `macosx/HandBrake.xcodeproj'

   * select active configuration standard

   * select active target HandBrake

   * click Build or Build and Go

The first time it builds will take a bit of time. You may use the Build
Results window to watch it progress. A large partof the build is
invoking the external build system which poduces quite a lot of log
output. Much of that output are warnings and errors that are part of
the normal build process for 3rd-party contributed modules so in
general you need not do anything. However, if Xcode itself reports the
build failed, then you must take corrective action.

Unfortunately, due to limitations of Xcode we do not have hooks in
place to offer finer-grained control over per-module make actions for
the (external) build system. Thus, you will have to use terminal to
accomplish those tasks. Just `cd' into the build directory which is
associated with your active configuration and perform any necessary
`make' commands. Be careful not to issue commands from the terminal
simultaneously with Xcode tasks as that will confuse both Xcode and
make and likely corrupt your build directory.

When you click clean in Xcode it will not perform an external build
clean. Basically HandBrakeCLI and HandBrake.app are the only products
which have full Xcode iterative development flexibility.

Each configuration uses a different `build' directory. This makes it
possible to build each configuration and switch between them without
losing their respective build state. The description of each
configuration and the name convention for build directories are as
follows:

`standard'
     This configuration will build to the host native architecture.
     Build directory is `build.standard' .  The standard variant
     produces optimized code without debug information.

`debug'
     This configuration will build to the host native architecture.
     Build directory is `build.standard' .  The debug variant produces
     unoptimized code with debug information.

`standard.i386'
     This configuration is used to build for the i386 architecture.
     Build directory is `build.standard.i386' .

`standard.x86_64'
     This configuration is used to build for the x86_64 architecture.
     Build directory is `build.standard.x86_64' .

`standard.ppc'
     This configuration is used to build for the ppc architecture.
     Build directory is `build.standard.ppc' .

`standard.ppc64'
     This configuration is used to build for the ppc64 architecture.
     Build directory is `build.standard.ppc64' .
