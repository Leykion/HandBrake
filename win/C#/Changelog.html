Windows Platform Specific Changlog.<br />

    <h3>Major Changes</h3>

    - Video Preview window using QuickTime or VLC. (5 to 60 second preview clips) <br />

    - Minimise to system tray is now optional with the ability to turn off balloon tip notifications.<br />
    - Picture settings can now be stored in presets. (Optional setting)<br />
    - Built-in Presets now automatically update when a change is detected.<br />
    - Preset XML data files are now stored in the users application data folder which allows for each system account user can have their own presets.<br />
    - Users can "update" their own presets. (Rather than delete & re-create)<br />
    - Improved control over how logs are stored. Logs are now kept in the Application data folder for each user. <br />

    <h3>Minor Improvements / Changes</h3>

	    * Minor changes in the Destination Browse dialog to improve usability.<br />
	    * Design improvements. Removed smaller fonts where possible. Fixed a few design inconsistencies.<br />
